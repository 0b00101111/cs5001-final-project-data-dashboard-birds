Data Sets:
Two datasets, snowy_owl_records.csv and snowy_owl_trend.csv are used in this project. The sources are as below:
1. Snowy Owl Records Dataset
Source: eBird Basic Dataset
Description: Contains detailed records of Snowy Owl sightings, including geographic coordinates, observation counts,
dates, and observer information.

2. Snowy Owl Trend Dataset
Source: NatureCounts
Description: Provides annual trends in Snowy Owl populations, including population estimates, migration patterns,
and habitat changes.

Classes and Objectives:
I created two classes: BirdObservation and SnowyOwlTrend. The BirdObservation class will represent detailed data of the
observation record of snowy owl in Canada, including identifiers, common and scientific names, geographic coordinates,
observation dates, observer IDs, and counts. The SnowyOwlTrend class will represent the data which demonstrate the amount
 of snowy owls in recent 52 years, including the index and its confidence intervals. I created those classes in the way
 that, when an object is initiated, a pandas dataframe will be created based on the dataset, and provided some basic
 method such as get_descriptive_summary.

Intended Data Analysis
The most important analysis in my plan is to see the correlation between the observation data and the (estimated) population
data of a bird species(in this project, Snowy Owl is used as an example). Observations are self_reported records from volunteers
who log the essential data with the ebird application when see or hear a bird. The population data, on the other hand,
though still not accurate numbers, is collected and calculated in a more systematic and scientific way.

User Interaction and Visualization
In Milestone 2, I plan to develop analysis includes a hotspot map of Snowy Owls in Canada, a bar chart to show the observation
 counts for each month, allowing a user to filter this bar chart to see data of a certain year for the purpose of interaction.
